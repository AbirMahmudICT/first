            <p>2 years ago I found myself in a bad place. I had worked in a fintech startup as a customer support for 4 years, and while I adored the people, any meaningful career change within the company never happened. I had side projects, sure, but at the end of the day my worth was still calculated very plainly by the amount of calls and e-mails I handled per day. While wholesome coworkers can keep you going, deep down where it really matters, it can be... well, quite soul crushing.</p>

            <h3 class="orange_highlight">2020 - 2024 | Programming Learner.</h3>
            <p>My training started with the review of Three tier architecture, HTML and database design. This was just to ensure I knew the basics that were used in the development of an application. I also had a brief session on GIT to understand the basics of GIT. Then, I had a requirement gathering session, which helped me to know how the requirements should be collected and to be thorough while gathering them. After this, there was a session on wire-frames and database design. Next, was a session about APIs which was something new to me.</p>
