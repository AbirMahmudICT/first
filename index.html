            <p>2 years ago I found myself in a bad place. I had worked in a fintech startup as a customer support for 4 years, and while I adored the people, any meaningful career change within the company never happened.

While wholesome coworkers can keep you going, deep down where it really matters, it can be... well, quite soul crushing.</p>
