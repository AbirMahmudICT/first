            <p>2 years ago I found myself in a bad place. I had worked in a fintech startup as a customer support for 4 years, and while I adored the people, any meaningful career change within the company never happened. I had side projects, sure, but at the end of the day my worth was still calculated very plainly by the amount of calls and e-mails I handled per day. While wholesome coworkers can keep you going, deep down where it really matters, it can be... well, quite soul crushing.</p>
